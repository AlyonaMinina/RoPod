# Examples of RoPod applications


## Semi-automated image analysis used to track root hair tips
This method allows to track, from an image stack of a growing root,

<img src = "/Images/Growing_root.gif" width = "250">

the tip of a growing root hair

 <img src = "/Images/Hair_tracking.gif" height = "100">

It is a semi-automated method that requires the software [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), a [pre roo hair tracking macro](https://github.com/AlyonaMinina/RoPod/blob/main/1-Pre-root%20hair%20tracking and the chore [tracking macro](https://github.com/AlyonaMinina/RoPod/blob/main/2-Root%20hair%20tracking).
